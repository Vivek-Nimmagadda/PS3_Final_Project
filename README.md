Player Prediction Using Python

This Project can mainly be divided into 3 steps: 1) Scraping the player data from howstat.com using UiPath tool; 2) Predicting the best player based on their stats using Machine Learning Models; 3) Visualizing the Plots using Tkinter GUI.

1) Scraping the player data: Scraping is done using UiPath tool. The main.xaml file consists of all the steps for achieving the same. The PS3 Project.mp4 file is a video showing the working of UiPath tool in scraping and storing the data in an Excel file.
